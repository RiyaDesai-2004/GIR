# Gujarati Image Recognition

Gujarati Image Recognition (GIR) is a deep learning project that classifies images of dogs vs cats and recognizes Gujarati handwritten digits using TensorFlow and custom datasets.

## 🔍 Features

- ✅ Dog vs Cat classification using transfer learning with TensorFlow.
- ✅ Custom Gujarati digit dataset for OCR (Optical Character Recognition).
- ✅ Clean, preprocessed image datasets ready for training.
- ✅ Jupyter Notebook and PDF version included for dog vs cat classifier.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **OpenCV (for preprocessing)**
- **NumPy, Matplotlib**
## 📦 Dataset

--> Gujarati digit dataset is pre-organized under:

- gujarati digits dataset/preprocessed images/

- 10 folders (0–9) contain labeled image samples.
##  Sample Output
Add sample classification results, e.g.:

✅ Cat Image → Cat

✅ Gujarati digit image (folder 3/) → 3
## 🔍 Project Summary (Short Explanation):
The Gujarati Image Recognition (GIR) project applies deep learning techniques to two key tasks:

Dog vs Cat Classification using a TensorFlow-based model.

Gujarati Handwritten Digit Recognition using a custom image dataset.

It uses Python, TensorFlow, and image preprocessing to train models for accurate classification. The project includes Jupyter notebooks, pretrained models, and a structured dataset.
